>>>>>>> 4ece7dcc3e59c0603fe26f487d5e3ac6c06ba960
 This code is written to calculate PDFs and statistical properties of the chosen 
 variables (vorticity, surface wind speed, and vertically integrated anomalous 
 temperature) according to :
         Camargo, S. J., & Zebiak, S. E. (2002). Improving the Detection and 
         Tracking of Tropical Cyclones in Atmospheric General Circulation 
             Models. Weather and   Forecasting, 17(6), 1152â€“1162.
